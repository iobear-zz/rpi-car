Intro
=======

I wanted to make a project with a Raspberry Pi, having a computer that size has to be fun!
So I found a RC-car without the remote control, and decided to make a new remote with a PS3 controller.
<br/> After only 2 days of work it was running, so why not do something more, this is way to easy.

The rpi-car
-----
I will try to divide the project up into manageable parts, this way you should be able to pick the part you find most interesting.

### one script car
 The one script car, is a good way to start exploring how to control your car with python commands, via the GPIO on the RPi.
 Go to the one-script-car folder to read more.
