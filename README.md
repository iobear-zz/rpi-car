Intro
=======

I wanted to make a project with a Raspberry Pi, having a computer that size has to be fun!
So I found a RC-car without the remote control, and decided to make a new remote with a PS3 controller.
 After 2 days of work it was working, so why not make something more out of the project, this is way to easy!
<br/> I loved playing with the RC car as a kid, so why not use the project as a way to teach electronics, programming and Linux.

I will try to divide the project up into manageable parts, this way you should be able to pick the part you find most interesting.

### one scrtpt car
 One script car, is a good way to start exploring how to control your car, with python commands, via the GPIO on the RPI.
